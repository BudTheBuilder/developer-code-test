# CMA Developer Code Test

##Submmited code includes:
1. Python script (dbToJSON.py) that extracts and writes relevant artwork info to a json file. To run, be sure to include the path to cma-artworks.db as an cmd line argument.
2. The web application. Normally this would be done on a framework like .NET in VS, but for sake of simplicity and portability, I'm only including the html/css/js files. Simply open index.html in a browser*. 

*If using Chrome to test, make sure to include the cmd line flag --allow-file-access-from-files because it's a bug/feature that google won't allow local files to be read with ajax. Doesn't seem to work on IE either, but does work on MS Edge.
